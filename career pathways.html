	<p>The Profession Connections Center at the University of Florida is aware that a major does not directly correlate to a career. We just introduced our new Career Pathways concept, which incorporates Career Clusters to let you consider many options for your post-graduation route. Our Career Pathways methodology aims to connect your learning opportunities to the information and competencies you require for further study and work in the future.</p>
	<h2 align="center">What is a Career Pathway?</h2>
	<p>Career clusters are collections of related professions and sectors that have a shared set of competencies. They were created to make it simple for you to look at a range of job options and choose your career path for where you want to go once you graduate. Because majors do not usually equate to occupations, career clusters are purposely not linked to academic majors.</p>
	<p>Our Career Community webpages have been revised in accordance with the Career Pathways paradigm. Our Professional Communities are groupings based on industries and interests that offer connections and resources that are specifically designed to support your career journey. You may connect with the C3, other students, alumni, and industries by creating places for communities to congregate.</p>

Because majors do not usually equate to occupations, career clusters are purposely not linked to academic majors.</p>
	<p>We have modified our Career Community webpages to reflect the Career Pathways approach. Our Professional Communities are groupings based on industry and affinity that offer connections and specialized tools to enhance your career journey. By creating locations for communities to congregate, you may connect with the C3, other students, alumni, and businesses.</p>
	<strong>Engaging with your career pathway will help you:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Make connections at UF and elsewhere to learn more about yourself and your options for a career</li>
		<li>Recognize the in-demand professions in your field(s) of interest and develop those</li>
		<li>Participate in a range of activities that suit your individual interests.</li>
		<li>Prepare you for success after graduation</li>
	</ul>
