	<h1 align="center">What is Career Planning?</h1>
	<p>Learning, discussing, and reflecting about your career are all considered to be part of career planning. The Career Connections Center views career planning as a continual process that aids in self-discovery, professional growth, experience accumulation, and preparation for subsequent steps. Our approach to career planning is centered on finding answers, learning new information, and acting.</p>
	<h3>How can Career Planning help you where you are today?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>We consider you to be the expert. In order for you to live independently and responsibly about your job decisions, we assist you in identifying your potential.</li>
		<li>We aid you in developing your personal and/or professional objectives, expanding your range of options.</li>
		<li>We inquire appropriately and provide assignments and feedback to encourage reflection on your subsequent actions.</li>
	</ul>
