	<p>Micro internships are brief, project-based positions that are made available online by businesses. The length of a project, which typically ranges from 5 to 40 hours of work, might be anywhere from a week to a few months. Projects are intended to be finished all year long, and students are typically paid a set amount. Micro internships are designed to supplement current experiential learning and may be appealing to those who lack the resources or academic flexibility to relocate for a full-time internship. Additionally, micro internships give students access to practical experience while giving employers a scalable opportunity to engage with talent.</p>

Micro internships give students the chance to finish tasks while also assessing businesses for potential full-time employment prospects.
